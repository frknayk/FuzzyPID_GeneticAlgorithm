Tuning fuzzy PID controller with genetic algorithm

According to the paper, “ PID Type Fuzzy Controller and parameters adaptive
method” by Wu Zhi Qiao, Masaharu Mizumoto, while given fuzzy rules and 
control architecture, we can tune 4 parameters : Ke,Kde,alpha and beta
with genetic algorithm.

System is the CSTR and runga-kutta system model is provided in the simulink file.

Explanation is provided in the report file
